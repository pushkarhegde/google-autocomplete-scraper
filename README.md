 Google is the king of search engines, making it the ultimate source of data for a whole host of use cases.

 If you work as a marketer or an analyst specifically with search engine optimization (SEO), I bet you already use Google autocomplete for keyword research.

 A user performing a search will generally see 3 - 10 suggestions, that best matches the entered term, and a click on any keyword from the list leads to the search results page.

 Finding keywords with autocomplete may work fine but it is a mundane and time-consuming process if you copy keywords manually from Google suggestions.
